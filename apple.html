            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes
                in consumer electronics, computer software and online services. Apple is the largest information
                technology company by revenue and, since January 2021, the world's most valuable company.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to
                develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple
                Computer, Inc. in 1977, and sales of its computers, among them the Apple II, grew quickly. It went
                public in 1980, to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers
                featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh, announced in a
                critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by Ridley Scott. The high cost of its products and
                limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak
                departed Apple amicably,[15] while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple employees with
                him.[16]

            <p style="text-align: justify;"> As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the
                1990s, Apple lost considerable
                market share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft Windows on Intel PC clones. The board recruited
                CEO Gil Amelio, who prepared the struggling company for eventual success with extensive reforms, product
                focus and layoffs in his 500-day tenure. In 1997, Amelio bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful
                operating-system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company; he replaced Amelio. Apple became
                profitable again through a number of tactics. First, a revitalizing campaign called "Think different",
                and by launching the iMac and iPod. In 2001, it opened a retail chain, the Apple Stores, and has
                acquired numerous companies to broaden its software portfolio. In 2007, the company launched the iPhone
                to critical acclaim and financial success. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months
                later. He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">The company receives significant criticism regarding the labor practices of
                its contractors, its
                environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive behavior and materials
                sourcing. In August 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1
                trillion.[17][18] Two years later, it became the first company valued at over $2 trillion, and the first
                valued at over $3 trillion in January 2022.[19][20][21] The company enjoys a high level of brand
                loyalty, and is ranked as the world's most valuable brand; as of January 2021, there are 1.65 billion
                Apple products in active use.</p>

        <h2 class="veg">iOS 15</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">iOS 15 is the fifteenth and current major release of the iOS mobile operating
            system developed by Apple for
            its iPhone and iPod Touch lines of products. It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers
            Conference on June 7, 2021, as the successor to iOS 14, and released to the public on September 20, 2021</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Apple in June 2021 introduced the latest version of its iOS operating system,
            iOS 15, which was released on September 20, 2021. iOS 15 introduces new features for FaceTime calls, tools
            to reduce distractions, a new notifications experience, added privacy features, complete redesigns for
            Safari, Weather, and Maps, and more.</p>

        <h3>Notification</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Notifications have been redesigned in iOS 15, adding contact photos for people
            and larger icons for apps. To
            reduce distraction, a notification summary collects notifications together for delivery at an appropriate
            time and arranges notifications by priority.</p>

        <h3>Focus</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Focus is a new feature that can filter notifications and apps based on what a
            user wishes to focus on at a
            certain time. When a user's Focus is blocking incoming notifications, their status will be displayed to
            others in Messages. iOS will suggest a Focus for different occasions, such as work hours or winding down for
            bed, using on-device intelligence, but users can also create a custom Focus. When a Focus is set on one
            Apple device, it automatically applies to other Apple devices.</p>
